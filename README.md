# Ready to get to work bringing agile to gov?

## Look in Projects to get started.

1. Click into a project to view suggested tasks and ideas.
2. If you see one you want to do, assign yourself to the task (issue) using the menu on the right.
3. Change the label from "Help Wanted" to "Assigned".
4. You can discuss your task, ask questions, and give updates at the Agile Champions meeting, held every Tuesday at 9:30PT/12:30ET.

## Have an idea for a new task or project?

1. Add a new Issue using the menu at the top. Add details about your idea in the comment section. 
2. You can assign the task to yourself using the menu on the right, or change the label to "Help Wanted" if you don't necessarily want to own the task yourself.
3. We'll take a look at your idea and assign it to a project (or create a new project if necessary).
